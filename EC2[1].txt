**************** EC2 ****************

Q.1) Create a new EC2 instance with a specific Amazon Machine Image (AMI) of your choice.
Choose an appropriate EC2 instance type based on your application's requirements.
Configure security groups to allow specific inbound and outbound traffic.
Assign an Elastic IP address to the instance for a static public IP (if needed).
Connect to the instance using SSH or RDP, depending on the operating system.
==>



Q.2) Creating and Customizing an AMI:
Launch an EC2 instance based on an existing AMI.
Install necessary software packages and configure the instance according to your application needs.
Create a new custom AMI from the configured EC2 instance to capture the changes made.
Ensure that the custom AMI is private and securely stored.
==>


Q.3) Setting up EBS Volumes:
Attach an additional EBS volume to an existing EC2 instance.
Format and mount the EBS volume to make it usable as additional storage.
Test the persistence and data integrity by storing and retrieving data from the attached EBS volume.
==>

Q.3) VPC and Subnet Configuration:
Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
Create multiple subnets, public and private, within the VPC.
Configure the route tables and internet gateway to enable internet access for instances in the public subnet.
Launch EC2 instances in both the public and private subnets and verify network connectivity.
==>

Q.4)Implementing Load Balancer:
Set up an Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB).
Register EC2 instances with the load balancer to distribute traffic evenly.
Configure health checks to monitor the health of instances and automatically remove unhealthy instances from the load balancer.
Test the load balancer's functionality by accessing the application through its DNS name.
